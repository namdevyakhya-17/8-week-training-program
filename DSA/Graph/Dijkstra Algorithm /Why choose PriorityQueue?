Dijkstra always needs the node with the minimum distance first.
** Priority Queue gives: **
  Insert → O(log n)  
  Remove min → O(log n)  
  Always gives smallest distance node

** TreeSet<Pair> **
  TreeSet can also work because it maintains sorted order and supports decrease-key by removing and re-inserting elements. 
  However, Priority Queue is simpler and faster in practice due to lower constant overhead.

** Queue **
A normal Queue processes nodes in FIFO order, not based on minimum distance. 
This works only for unweighted graphs (BFS), but Dijkstra requires always choosing the minimum distance node.

Queue always removes in insertion order, not smallest distance.
Even if Pair implements Comparable, queue will NOT automatically reorder elements.
You insert:
        (2, 10)
        (3, 1)
Queue order: (2,10) → (3,1)
It will remove (2,10) first ❌
But Dijkstra needs (3,1) first.
So implementing Comparable is useless for Queue.
